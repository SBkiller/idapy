Tutorial Conventions
====================

`IDA IPython <https://github.com/james91b/ida_ipython>`__ is used in the
examples unless stated otherwise. For brevity, assume the following code
precedes any example code.

.. code:: python

    import idaapi, idc, idautils
    import sark

As Sark is a large, evolving library, the API documentation provided
here will be partial and only include what is needed to get you started.
However, the Sark code in itself is heavily documented.
